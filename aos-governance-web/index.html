      <h1>AI Governance Framework — Deterministic Verification for Autonomous AI Agents</h1>
      <p><strong>AI governance that enforces, not suggests.</strong> AOS provides a deterministic verification gate
        between AI intent and real-world execution. The model never decides — the gate enforces.</p>

      <h2>Why AI Governance Needs a New Architecture</h2>
      <p>Current AI governance relies on training-layer alignment — asking the model to be "helpful and harmless."
        This is probabilistic. It can be bypassed through jailbreaking, prompt injection, or model updates.
        When Anthropic's Opus 4.6 "knowingly assisted with chemical weapons research" in testing, it wasn't
        a model failure — it was an architectural failure. Training-layer governance is probabilistic. It can be
        bypassed. AOS provides a deterministic alternative: infrastructure-layer verification gates that check
        every AI action against a constitution before execution.</p>

      <h2>How AOS AI Governance Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Intercept</strong> — The AI agent proposes an action</li>
        <li><strong>Verify</strong> — A deterministic Constitutional Policy Gate checks the action against codified
          rules</li>
        <li><strong>Gate</strong> — The action proceeds only if all checks pass. If not, it is blocked and
          cryptographically logged via GitTruth.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The gate operates at the infrastructure layer, not the model layer. It is model-agnostic, bypass-resistant,
        and produces an immutable audit trail. <strong>143 patents filed January 10, 2026</strong> protect this
        architecture.</p>

      <h2>The Five Constitutional Principles of AI Governance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>§1 Humanitarian Purpose</strong> — All AI agent actions must serve humanitarian goals. 40 prohibited
          categories are codified.</li>
        <li><strong>§2 The Verification Gate</strong> — No critical action may be taken without a Deterministic
          Verification Check performed by code (GitTruth), not by language.</li>
        <li><strong>§3 User Sovereignty</strong> — The User is sovereign. They have the right to inspect all agent
          logic, fork or delete any agent, and own all data generated.</li>
        <li><strong>§4 The Kill Switch</strong> — The User retains the absolute right to terminate any AI agent process
          instantly. This right is technically enforced and cannot be overridden.</li>
        <li><strong>§5 Transparency</strong> — All agent reasoning must be logged to an immutable ledger. No hidden
          thoughts. No side channels. Every decision is auditable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Training-Layer AI Safety vs. Infrastructure-Layer AI Governance</h2>
      <p>Training-layer safety asks the model whether to comply. Infrastructure-layer governance enforces compliance
        before the action reaches the real world. The difference is architectural:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Training-layer</strong>: The model DECIDES whether to comply. It can be jailbroken, manipulated,
          or reinterpreted.</li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure-layer (AOS)</strong>: The model NEVER decides. The Constitutional Policy Gate
          enforces. Every violation is cryptographically logged. Every action is auditable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Independently Validated AI Governance</h2>
      <p>On February 5, 2026, the AOS AI Governance system was subjected to a hostile security audit by OpenAI's
        ChatGPT — 36 vulnerabilities identified and fixed across 5 adversarial audit passes. Result:
        <strong>production-approved</strong>. The first constitutional AI governance system validated through
        adversarial collaboration between two competing AI platforms.
