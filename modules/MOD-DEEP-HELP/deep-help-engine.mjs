/**
 * MOD-DEEP-HELP — Godfather Multi-Level Role-Aware Deep Help & Granular Web App Access Engine
 * Sourced & generalized from C:\repos-greentree\compliancepro-platform
 *
 * Features:
 *  1. Multi-level collapsible Contents hierarchy (BASICS, FEATURES, PROJECT MANAGER GUIDES, ADMINISTRATION, HELP & SUPPORT)
 *  2. Dual-mode inside every topic:
 *     - Summary View (Quick Guide): Fast overview, key takeaways, 3-step quick start
 *     - Complete Guide (Full Guide): Step-by-step documentation, callout boxes, role tables, pro tips, troubleshooting
 *  3. Universal Help + Custom Per-Tenant / Per-App Help merge engine (supports custom topic overrides & additions)
 *  4. Granular Web App User Matrix:
 *     - Per-user checkboxes for Visual Pin Board access (`pinboardAccess`, `pinboardTeamView`)
 *     - Super-Admin link visibility gates (`leadsQuotes`, `socialCommand`, `commercialAddons`, `billingGateways`)
 *       so Web Apps like `oneem.sonitor.com` hide commercial website tools from non-Super-Admins by default.
