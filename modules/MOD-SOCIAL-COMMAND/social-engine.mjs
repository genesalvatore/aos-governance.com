/**
 * GreenTree Universal Module: `MOD-SOCIAL-COMMAND` (`modules/MOD-SOCIAL-COMMAND/social-engine.mjs`)
 * =================================================================================================
 * Sovereign Multi-Customer & Multi-Profile Facebook Page Graph API v21.0 Publisher, Automated
 * First-Comment Link Injector, Background Queue Scheduler, Facebook Group Admin Co-Pilot, and
 * Privacy-Preserving Remote Health Telemetry Engine.
 *
 * Architectural Mandates:
 *   1. Every Social Profile & Post is Bound to a Customer (`siteKey` + `siteName`).
 *   2. $0/mo Forever — Zero third-party SaaS subscriptions.
 *   3. 100% Meta Compliant — Uses official Meta Graph API v21.0 (`/{page-id}/feed`, `/{page-id}/photos`,
 *      `/{post-id}/comments`) for Facebook Business Pages, plus a safe 1-Click Group Admin Co-Pilot for
 *      Facebook Groups (never uses risky headless browser bots).
 *   4. Customer Privacy & PII Opt-Out Support:
 *      - Customers can opt out of content/PII aggregation into Master Command (`command.greentreehosting.com`)
 *        for both `MOD-SOCIAL-COMMAND` (`socialContentOptOut`) and `MOD-LEAD-VAULT` (`leadsPiiOptOut`).
 *      - When opted out, Master Command still receives anonymized operational health telemetry so
 *        engineers can verify remote forms, PostgreSQL 16 vaults, SmarterMail relays, and Graph API
 *        schedulers are functioning without storing or viewing customer PII or private post copy.
